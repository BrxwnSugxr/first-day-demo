### Clone the Repository:
> git clone <repository-url>

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone. You can find this URL on the GitHub repository page.

### Navigate to the Cloned Directory:
> cd <repository-directory>

Replace `<repository-directory>` with the name of the directory created when you cloned the repository.

### Add Changes:
> git add .

This command stages all changes. You can also specify individual files if you only want to stage specific changes.

### Commit Changes:
> git commit -m "Your commit message here"

Replace "Your commit message here" with a brief and meaningful commit message.

### Push Changes to GitHub:
>git push origin main

This assumes that your main branch is named `main`. If your main branch is named differently (e.g., `master`), replace `main` with the actual branch name. The `origin` is the default name given to the remote repository when you clone it. If you cloned the repository using a different name, use that name instead.
